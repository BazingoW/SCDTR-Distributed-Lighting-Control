# Continuous Distributed Systems in Real Time - Distributed Lighting Control

In this project we developed a distributed lighting system based on 2 Leds inside a Box, by opening and closing the box the leds would adapt their luminosity. Each led is supopsed to represent the light over a desk, and so if no one was at that desk the led would be less bright. The leds would communicate with each other in order to achieve the required luminosity levels and saving powe at the same time.
